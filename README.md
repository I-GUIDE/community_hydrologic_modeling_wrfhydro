# community_hydrologic_modeling_wrfhydro

The I-GUIDE project is extending and enhancing cyberinfrastructure that enables National Water Model (NWM) data products to be configured and used to address specific research questions. The NWM is an implementation of the Weather Research and Forecasting Model Hydrological modeling system (WRF-Hydro) at continental-scale. The cyberinfrastructure and workflows needed to implement, set up and configure the data product subsets for a modeling domain of interest are complex, and demand a high level of skill from researchers, thus limiting broad applicability.  I-GUIDE is building on modeling capability developed by the CyberGIS-Compute enabling computing for the hydrology community, and integrating data connectors and processors from the GeoEDF project to deploy simple to use workflows for setting up and running WRF-Hydro configured like the NWM for any watershed specified in the US NWM modeling domain.
